# JUCECmakeRepoPrototype
A prototype to model a way to create an entire repo using JUCE6 and CMake.

The main concept is to set all the different variables (where JUCE is, custom modules, etc) in the top CMakeLists.txt, then add all your projects with very little setup.

JUCE6 just came out and is in testing stages, so feel free to report any bugs!
